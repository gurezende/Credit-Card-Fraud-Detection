## [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/gurezende/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)

This is a classic Data Science project created in Python to detect fraudulent transactions in this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download&select=creditcard.csv).

The main skills demonstrated in this project are:
* *Exploratory Data Analysis*: I have done a quick check and plotted some graphics to get a better understanding of the data. However, the variables were transformed, so not too deep analysis could be performed.
* *Data Visualization*: graphics plotted (bars, boxplots, scatterplots etc)
* *Data scaling and balancinginputation*: I have scaled some variables to make the data more uniform and used **Oversampling and Undersampling** techniques to balance the dataset, as it contains only 0.17% of the minoritary class.
* *Model Selection*: There are 4 models. I used Cross Validation to select the best option, reaching over **99%** of F1 score (Precision / Recall)
